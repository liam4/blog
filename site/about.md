# towerofnix's Blog Site

Welcome to the site! I use this place to [ramble](archive/text.html) and
[share stuff I've drawn](archive/art.html). Maybe some of it'll be interesting
to someone.

## FAQ

**I want to contact you or comment on one of your posts but have no idea how.**
Sending me a tweet [@towerofnix][twitter] or [an email][guess] is probably the
best way right now.

**towerofnix is really hard to pronounce and write and say. Any other names??**
You might want to stick to towerofnix if you're specifically talking about,
e.g., my blog, my YouTube channel, or whatever. That's the username I've taken
for myself, and it's what people can search to find me. But if you're talking
about me, as a person, please use Florrie. (If you're curious, there's a whole
blog post on this topic [here][usernames-post]!)

**What's this blog engine?**
It's a completely custom, hand-made one. [Here's the source code][blog-source]
if you want to use it or just play around with it.

**What the eff is the standard text editor and why is it ed(1)?**
Apparently, ed is useful because you can use it on just about any Unix system.
(I think that's why the call it "standard".) So if you know how to use it,
you'll never be without the ability to harness its amazing splendid powers.
A little wikipediabird is telling me that ed was developed in 1969, which
should be enough reason for *anybody* to learn it, but I've never actually
used it myself. Oops.

**How frequently asked are these questions?** Never. Ask me some questions,
please? (Hint: see FAQ.)
