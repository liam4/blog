        <p>I was bored at a place I was visiting and decided to practice my Elian Script writing. Only a very wet marker and a napkin were available. The marker sort of leaked through the napkin, making it act like a pressure-sensitive pen on overdrive.. that was difficult, but also really interesting, to work with!</p>
        <p>None of this is outstanding, but it was fun to make anyways. You&#39;ll have to flip and rotate the picture to read it all, if you&#39;re curious.</p>
