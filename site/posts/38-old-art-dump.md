# Old art dump

Ooh secret old art dump! Most of these are grabbed from an old mini-blog I had on the Wings of Fire wiki; a few are recovered from a backup of my old laptop. These are all really, *really* old - from 2015 and 2016 - so they don't really say anything about my current art, but I find them interesting to look at anyways. So for posterity and curiosity, here's a dump of old things I drew.

<art noext>38-first-dragon-drawing</art>

<art noext>38-second-dragon-drawing</art>

<art noext>38-sleet-and-floe-in-a-snow-cave</art>

<art noext>38-not-good-at-all</art>

<art noext>38-moon's-mountain-home</art>

<art noext>38-hole-in-the-ceiling</art>

<art noext>38-drew-this-null</art>

<art noext>38-nightwings-tunnel</art>

A couple collaborations with [LittleLynx][littlelynx]:

<art noext>38-littlelynx-collab-clay</art>

She drew the dragon, Clay; I added some things to the background and the sparkly effects.

<art noext>38-littlelynx-collab-tsunami</art>

Like with Clay, she drew Tsunami, and most of the background; I added sparklies.

Also some outtakes: [a drawing of a scene](static/media/38-the-wingery.png) that I didn't do too much with, [some crazy ruler testing](static/media/38-sky-picture.png), and [a picture of Sunny with a turtle she caught from the lake](static/media/38-sunny's-turtle.png) that I had trouble turning into an actual picture.
