        <p>Oh dear, I haven&#39;t published anything to this blog in nearly an entire month!
        Obviously that&#39;s my fault; sorry nothing&#39;s really come to mind.</p>
        <p><em>However,</em> I did still do things in the last month; so, here&#39;s a simple little
        summary of what comes to mind:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>I worked on <a href="https://github.com/towerofnix/http-music">http-music</a>. A <a href="https://github.com/towerofnix/http-music/compare/master@%7B2017-07-01%7D...master@%7B2017-08-03%7D">lot</a>.
        Interesting and important new features:
        the entire playlist format has been changed (e.g. downloaders can be
        manually specified per-track or <a href="https://gist.github.com/towerofnix/cd7465a82c8b367eef221e61c3b6186e">per-group</a>);
        it now supports <a href="https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html">a bunch more sites</a>;
        playlists can be downloaded from websites;
        playlists that are modified at runtime (&quot;active&quot; playlists) can be exported;
        and SoX now works again, so you don&#39;t need to install mpv (which has been
        <em>very</em> difficult to install, for me).</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I put some effort into <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/44849645/4633828">a couple</a>
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/45237361/4633828">StackOverflow posts</a>, but they were ignored.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I <a href="https://towerofnix.github.io/1500000000000/">celebrated</a> hitting Unix timestamp 1500000000.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I hacked around with my Raspberry Pi a bunch! My entire setup is now
        (optionally) battery-powered, has a (small) monitor, and fits in a (hardly
        portable) suitcase. <a href="posts/11-raspberry-pi-madness.html">I wrote about my old setup a while ago;</a>
        maybe it&#39;d be potentially interesting to write about my new one!</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I drew a few things on paper. I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that drawing on
        paper is <em>much</em> nicer for, you know, drawing ideas??</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also went on a vacation for half the month. It was nice. (I&#39;m not sure if it
        makes up for this somewhat-underwhelming list of interesting things I did,
        though..!)</p>
