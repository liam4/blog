# Art dump August!!!!!!!!

August! A few new things - these are all different experiments. I'm pretty happy with all of these!

By the way, if you check my blog at the start of each month (whoa), I posted a couple other things in August: [an art dump of a lot of my ooooold art](posts/38-old-art-dump.html), and [an "it's 1:30 AM" ramble about the Wings of Fire graphic novel](posts/39-thoughts-on-wof-graphic-novel.html). Check those out if you're interested!
