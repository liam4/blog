        <p>Hello, world! Or whatever.</p>
        <p>This is just a test blog for now. I&#39;m planning on throwing art and stuff onto
        the site, so I guess you can expect that.</p>
        <p>This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve done a blog, and it&#39;ll probably be relatively
        short-lived like the others, but then again, I actually programmed this from
        scratch, and it&#39;s a kind of interesting setup (serverless/single-page). Here&#39;s
        the <a href="https://github.com/liam4/blog">GitHub repository</a> if you&#39;re curious!</p>

        <p>I guess I&#39;ll explain.</p>
        <p>In the very beginning(tm), I used Scratch to post art. Haha. Scratch was
        flawed, though. I wrote a little bit (somewhat indirectly) about that
        <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/152633913/">here</a>. But really Scratch just wasn&#39;t designed to, well,
        &quot;professionally&quot; share art.</p>
        <p>So for a while I was using Twitter to post art, instead. This wasn&#39;t perfect,
        either, though. Twitter is nice for sharing random junk like
        <a href="https://twitter.com/towerofnix/status/844198786410930176">this</a>, but not so much art projects I&#39;ve put semi-significant
        amounts of work into. It&#39;s not a very good place for sharing detailed feedback.</p>
        <p>What I eventually noticed is that a blog would work best. Just, you know, a
        place where I can post updates on the stuff I&#39;ve made, and at least have the
        technical potential for better discussion. So I programmed a blog, because I&#39;m
        too lazy to mess around with server hosts and Jekyll and other horrible stuff.
        (And also because I wanted to. Obligatory <a href="https://youtu.be/uNjxe8ShM-8?t=1m41s">motivation.</a>)</p>
