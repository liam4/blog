        <p>You can beat a game. Then it&#39;s done, but later on, you can explore it again. And yet, you know, the game is <em>done</em> - chances are there may not even be a future continuation of it (like a sequel, or a companion game). The series might&#39;ve long been finished, or abandoned. So.. it sort of gives a weird feeling, to wander the game&#39;s world. Like, you&#39;re exploring all that it will ever be - an ended, completed world, no more to come. It&#39;s strange.</p>
        <p>And that can be applied to.. people. Once someone&#39;s died, or taken a totally different, separate name online, they&#39;re gone. But what they&#39;ve written, what they&#39;ve made - that isn&#39;t. So you get the same feeling of exploring a finished, completed existence.</p>
        <p>Another thing. As you explore the finished game, or the creations of a person passed online, you might find new things. Maybe it&#39;s a close detail, or an obscure project.. or even just a different way of looking at, of understanding the game or person. So, even though there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s actually being made new, the game or person sort of still lives on, and has more to say. I guess that&#39;s what&#39;s so interesting about it.</p>
        <p>A game, a person passed - and yet there&#39;s still more to it. The completion of a game or the disappearance of a person; neither really means the end of the story.</p>
