        <p>I wrote a thing. Just kidding! I wrote an <em>idea</em> for a thing. Eventually it&#39;ll
        hopefully turn into a real story, but I&#39;ve got absolutely zero experience with
        writing stories, and even less dedicating to relatively big projects.</p>
        <p>I&#39;d like to do some concept art for the project. In my head I imagined it as a
        super fancy art project, but that&#39;s kind of a crazy idea, since the thing&#39;s so
        (relatively) big. So I&#39;ll most likely write it as a proper story first. Maybe I
        could try having pictures appear inside the page, so that there&#39;s still art to
        look at (in a printed version of it, anyways[*]), and I get to have somewhere
        to present the art (other than here).</p>
        <p>(* I&#39;m <em>not</em> making this a proper printed sold in stores thing, haha. It&#39;s
        just a thing that&#39;s stemmed from a school assignment. I&#39;ll probably print it
        for myself. That is, if I go anywhere with it.)</p>
