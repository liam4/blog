        <p>Courtesy of super-awesome <a href="https://eq.ed1.club">eq</a>, my site is now hosted on florrie.<a href="https://ed1.club">ed1.club</a> instead of towerofnix.github.io! Yay!!! <code>SPARKLES EMOJI</code> <code>SPARKLES EMOJI</code> <code>SPARKLES EMOJI</code>!</p>
        <p>I&#39;ll eventually get around to updating all the links to towerofnix.github.io/blog, but I already have a redirection system in place to make the transition a lot smoother.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>I&#39;ve somehow managed to not get around to mentioning it on my blog, but.....</p>
        <p>I&#39;ve got a Mastodon account! It&#39;s <a href="https://cybre.space/@florrie">florrie@cybre.space</a>. Cybre.space is supre cool. (I did <em>not</em> make that typo on purpose.) I post my art there before I put it up here on my blog, for a few reasons:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Putting together and publishing a blog post is kind of difficult. I&#39;ve written my blog system to be as pain-free as possible, but it&#39;s just not as easy as typing a toot and hitting send. Keeping it simple to share my art means I get to focus on what I&#39;m drawing instead of the process of sticking it online, since...</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I still put my art on this blog, but only once every month or so. (You&#39;ve noticed my art dumps, right?) Posting it in batches does keep my archive a bit cleaner, which is nice.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Posting art in batches lets me refine art when I want to. I made a doodle earlier this month and changed some things about it since; if I&#39;d already posted the art on my blog, I would have had to update the krita and PNG files, and then go through the entire process of pushing my site again.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>My Mastodon account&#39;s toots are set to private by default: only my followers can see them (and I have to manually approve follow requests). This makes it a lot easier to share things online - when I draw my art, I don&#39;t have to worry about what the entire world is going to think of it. It&#39;s easy for me to just decide to keep the piece exclusive to my hand-selected followers on Mastodon.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The tl;dr is: <strong>If you follow <a href="https://cybre.space/@florrie">me on Mastodon</a> (and I accept your follow request), you will get access to my art earlier than when I post it on my blog.</strong></p>
        <p>Also, eq helped me get some directory listings set up here. If you go to <a href="https://florrie.ed1.club/stuff">florrie.ed1.club/stuff</a>, you may or may not find random junk I throw there; I usually just use cubeupload, so it probably won&#39;t be populated all that quickly. I&#39;ve also got a /private folder for the Krita files of things I share on Mastodon but don&#39;t plan on posting to my blog. (Obviously, that directory is password-protected. If you want access, and I&#39;ve accepted your follow request on Mastodon, I can probably add an entry for you in my htpasswd file. Or something. I don&#39;t 100% know how I&#39;m going to use the folder yet!)</p>
