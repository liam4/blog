# Face doodles

[![A bunch of face doodles][image]][image]

Happy new year!

I got a tablet for Christmas; here's some doodling I did with it. (The image is really big and definitely looks better when you view it at full size; just click the image (or [here][image]) to see it in large.)

By the way, this was created with FREE<sup>TM</sup> software. I've moved from MediBang to Krita! Wow! MediBang Paint Pro is still a nice painter for sure, but it's not free-as-in-freedom *or* supported on Linux. (Ohh, that also means I don't have to use the family MacBook (nonfree again, aha) for drawing; I can just use my own Debian desktop!)

I could give you the Krita file for this but there's no real reason to; it's just one layer of the fill-circle brush. (Still [CC BY-SA 4.0][license], [per usual](posts/21-digital-art-again.html), though!)
