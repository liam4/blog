        <p>I made myself a text file for storing a log of the things I do in a few days
        ago. It&#39;s kind of shocking how huge it is; I really feel more productive when
        I can write a paragraph or two about all the different things I do in a day.
        I might release the whole file somewhere, at some point; meanwhile here&#39;s a
        bunch of excerpts from my log so far (it&#39;s ~2000 words long in just four days,
        haha).</p>
        <p>(This really is just an excerpt, though; I cut out a fair amount of videos or
        school that I didn&#39;t have much to comment on. Think of this page as a 100%
        quote of the interesting things in my log.)</p>
        <p>(I added a bunch of links for context; all the content was written by me,
        generally not long after I did whatever I mentioned in each paragraph.)</p>

        <ul>
        <li><p>I did a quiz on the general topic of waves in physical science. I started
        writing proper notes (as I do for my geometry); they’re helpful, but it’s
        a bit annoying that I didn’t start earlier. Oh well.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I merged Broadcast Vars into <a href="http://liam4.github.io/scrap-mod/">Scrap</a>. Scrap is pretty much finished
        at this point.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I looked up <a href="http://baiyon.com/en/">Baiyon</a> after a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB0A37E2F550DB027">PixelJunk Eden track</a>
        randomly played on iTunes. Apparently he collaborated with <a href="https://c418.org/">C418</a> to
        make the track <a href="https://c418.bandcamp.com/track/185">185</a>! What a small world.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I discovered Eden Obscura, a new PixelJunk game. This is being made RIGHT
        NOW, so it&#39;ll be something to keep an eye out for!</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I learned not to use the <code>fs-promise</code> NPM module anymore, since it&#39;s
        deprecated. Opt for <code>mz/fs</code> instead!</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I read <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2017/05/28/introspection/">a blog post</a> by <a href="https://eev.ee/">eevee</a>; it&#39;s quite
        ridiculously relatable (..though I haven&#39;t tried to do all the things I want
        to, yet..) and worth reading in general.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I read eevee&#39;s <a href="https://eev.ee/dev/2017/05/28/weekly-roundup-in-flux/">weekly update</a>. &quot;I&#39;m feeling pretty good?&quot; is
        generally the way I&#39;d describe the days that go well for me, too. — This was
        a comforting little paragraph to read:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I was held at gunpoint by glip and forced to help them design my own
        characters, which is, extremely cool and good. I’m starting to think they
        like doing creative work with me and think I have interesting ideas??&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="may-29th">May 29th</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><p>I read a few old stories I made and published on a blog I don&#39;t use anymore.
        They weren&#39;t that bad, considering I was around five when I wrote them.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I did a section on electromagnetic waves (and the electromagnetic spectrum)
        in my physical science course. I don&#39;t feel like the course teaches it very
        well; they never seem to give explanations on WHY anything works the way it
        does. I guess since this is essentially an introductory course, I&#39;m not
        really supposed to expect much of that, but.. it&#39;d be more interesting if
        they explained why things work the way they do at least a little, you know?</p>
        <p>While doing that I also wrote a few paragraphs on the math behind some
        behaviour of waves; I think that it&#39;ll be helpful, considering I&#39;ve been
        having a bit of trouble totally understanding the actual logic behind how
        waves work.</p>
        <p>Also, the questions for my science always feel a bit.. stupid? They&#39;re
        pretty much always a matter of &quot;can you remember all the facts we threw at
        you in the lecture?&quot; or &quot;did you take enough notes? - did you catch that
        one detail?&quot;. Of the five questions on the section, three of them were just
        &quot;which is true?&quot; questions on the positioning of different types of waves
        on the EM spectrum.</p>
        <p>(I mentioned that I&#39;m not really satisfied with what they teach, right?
        Like, they didn&#39;t even explain what the difference between electromagnetic
        and non-electromagnetic waves are.. just that some waves fall on the EM
        spectrum, and some don&#39;t, and that the ones that do are EM waves.)</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixu8tn__91E">a video</a> on a jailbreak for Super Mario World. It&#39;s a bit
        crazy to think that people are still discovering incredible bugs and tricks
        for ancient games like Super Mario World.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I worked on my Raspberry Pi music player a bit. That included improving
        the reliability of the iTunes/<code>python3 -m http.server</code> crawler; there
        shouldn&#39;t be any more missing albums or artists. I also added a few options
        to the command line interface for it; you can now keep and ignore specific
        groups. It&#39;s not technically more powerful than iTunes itself, but I&#39;d say
        it&#39;s a lot more comparable, now, and potentially easier to use.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DofhF-2sg1o">time mop</a> by <a href="http://www.billwurtz.com/">bill wurtz</a>. I wonder what
        makes the part where it goes past zero so funny? Maybe it&#39;s just the fact
        that it&#39;s doing something so <em>obviously</em> intuitively right (&quot;it&#39;s already
        going down, why stop at zero?&quot;) but also entirely unexpected (countdowns
        usually do stop at zero), combined with the happy, fun music in the
        background.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="may-30th">May 30th</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><p>I did a bunch of geometry and learned about transformation matrices. Well,
        it was mostly the topic of adding and multiplying matrices; that&#39;s not too
        surprising, though (and fine; it was interesting anyways). I wrote a bunch
        on multiplying matrices, but it only works in one case (when multiplying AxB
        * BxA matrices), which doesn&#39;t help much when the other case (multiplying
        AxB * BxC matrices) is also valid. I&#39;m pretty sure the lecture skipped
        glossed over that case.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I worked on the HTTP music player and added a fair few number of new
        features. The most important one is that it now preloads tracks while one is
        already playing; basically, it does all the work it needs to do to play a
        track while one is already playing, so that you don&#39;t notice it doing that
        work, and there&#39;s no significant pause between two tracks anymore. I also
        made it possible to play tracks in order rather than shuffled, fixed a bug
        or two, and cleaned up a bunch of code.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I read a few forum threads on the old Scratch forums (pre-2.0). They seem to
        have been a nicer place back then.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I worked a bit on my algebra on KhanAcademy and got to a point where I
        mastered 500 skills. That&#39;s nice. I also 100%-mastered a few earlier grade
        levels (third and fourth), as well as arithmetic; though they were all
        pretty much already mastered.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="may-31st">May 31st</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><p>I wrote a bit on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/comments/6een02/">an idea</a> to make Grandia III have competitive
        battles. I don&#39;t actually know how, though, and probably nobody on that
        subreddit does either, but whatever. The idea&#39;s still there.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I read an (adapted) article titled &quot;Will Technology Make You
        Healthier?&quot;. It&#39;s relatively self-descriptive, but it did touch on
        less obvious subjects like the controversy around future possibilities.
        (Is it alright to take from a human embyro to help someone, if in the
        process, the embyro will be destroyed?)</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msVuCEs8Ydo">&quot;The Speed of Light is NOT About Light&quot;</a>, by
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g">PBS Space Time</a>.</p>
        <p>It generally explained how the speed of light really doesn&#39;t derive from
        the speed that light travels at (rather it&#39;s the reverse), but I didn&#39;t
        find that it explained HOW particularly well (essentially they said that
        the universal constant, which the speed of light is equivalent to, must
        have the value that it does because of various other universal rules; but
        they didn&#39;t really explain the math that leads to it actually having the
        value it does).</p>
        <p>Particular topics I&#39;d like to know more of include how the Lorentz
        transformation works, the difference between that and the previously set
        system, what Maxwell&#39;s equations actually mean, and why they require a
        specific constant value for the universal constant.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I improved the style for <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>s on my blog. I think code looks nicer now;
        hopefully other people do, too.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I worked on my Raspberry Pi HTTP-based music player a bunch. For me, the
        person who programs it all, I split it into a bunch of different files; that
        was done over the course of a series of messy git commits and computer-swaps.
        I also made it so that the temporary song download now use actual tempfiles,
        rather than hidden files that are semi-automatically deleted by the play.js
        program - so now things are in general a lot cleaner. Before, pressing ^C
        wouldn&#39;t get rid of the WAV for the currently playing file (nor the WAV for
        the up-next song), so you&#39;d end up with tons of leftover WAVs, quickly eating
        up hundreds of megabytes (two new files every time you run the player!).
        That&#39;s fixed now - <em>real</em> tempfiles, which I&#39;m now using, are automatically
        deleted by the system!</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I made my music player use <code>util.promisify</code> for <code>fs</code> methods. So much for
        <code>mz/fs</code> being relevant.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>I read a short story about a kid who broke his leg and got it fixed, all
        without getting any donations or funding from family friends (or others),
        and his not-particularly-rich family didn&#39;t even have any financial stress,
        period. I won&#39;t spoil the trick - <a href="http://www.upworthy.com/when-her-5-year-old-broke-his-leg-this-mom-raised-0-its-actually-inspiring">read it yourself!</a></p>
        <p>Okay, but seriously, it&#39;s kind of interesting to think about not having any
        sort of fund-raiser needed. I never really thought of the stress that must
        come, you know, financially, in places where healthcare isn&#39;t free. I guess
        it&#39;s kind of taken for granted until you&#39;ve got experience with a place
        that doesn&#39;t have free healthcare.</p>
