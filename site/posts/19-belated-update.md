# Belated update

Oh dear, I haven't published anything to this blog in nearly an entire month!
Obviously that's my fault; sorry nothing's really come to mind.

*However,* I did still do things in the last month; so, here's a simple little
summary of what comes to mind:

* I worked on [http-music][http-music]. A [lot][http-music-commits].
  Interesting and important new features:
  the entire playlist format has been changed (e.g. downloaders can be
  manually specified per-track or [per-group][apply-example]);
  it now supports [a bunch more sites][youtube-dl-supportedsites];
  playlists can be downloaded from websites;
  playlists that are modified at runtime ("active" playlists) can be exported;
  and SoX now works again, so you don't need to install mpv (which has been
  *very* difficult to install, for me).

* I put some effort into [a couple][promise-all]
  [StackOverflow posts][redefine-private], but they were ignored.

* I [celebrated][1500000000000] hitting Unix timestamp 1500000000.

* I hacked around with my Raspberry Pi a bunch! My entire setup is now
  (optionally) battery-powered, has a (small) monitor, and fits in a (hardly
  portable) suitcase. [I wrote about my old setup a while ago;][pi-madness]
  maybe it'd be potentially interesting to write about my new one!

* I drew a few things on paper. I've come to the conclusion that drawing on
  paper is *much* nicer for, you know, drawing ideas??

I also went on a vacation for half the month. It was nice. (I'm not sure if it
makes up for this somewhat-underwhelming list of interesting things I did,
though..!)
