# Elian scribblings

![How am I supposed to write an alt-text for this?](static/media/24-elian-scribblings.png)

I was bored at a place I was visiting and decided to practice my Elian Script writing. Only a very wet marker and a napkin were available. The marker sort of leaked through the napkin, making it act like a pressure-sensitive pen on overdrive.. that was difficult, but also really interesting, to work with!

None of this is outstanding, but it was fun to make anyways. You'll have to flip and rotate the picture to read it all, if you're curious.
