# Art dump July!!!!!!!

July! I can't say I've started drawing *more*, but I did have a mini-revelation around half-way through the month: I'd rather focus on making *better* art instead of *more* art. So more trying new things and learning stuff from that, instead of stressing over just not making and sharing enough.

Okay, so, first, the big one. As is obvious to anyone who's played the game, this is a drawing of the hero from Dragon Quest IV - in particular, it's a trace/color of the PSX box art.

Here's the original DQ4 PSX box art, drawn by Akira Toriyama (I assume):
