        <p>It&#39;s been brought to my attention that my blog requires JavaScript to operate
        even the slightest reasonable amount. (It&#39;s true! Have you tried opening the
        site with JavaScript disabled?) I agree that that&#39;s bad for a number of
        reasons:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Anybody using a web browser without JavaScript has to go to the
        <em>code repository</em> to read the posts. I repeat - <em>code repository</em>.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Most websites work without JavaScript enabled, and a blog certainly has no
        good real-world excuse to require the language.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Having a single-page layout works really badly for a whole host of reasons,
        including Google indexing, Disqus comment sharing, and jumping to an element
        with an ID (you know, stuff like <code>index.html#contact</code>), which are all
        relatively important things.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>So I&#39;m rewriting the blog again. This time every update will be automatically
        converted by my own computer into static HTML documents. I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s
        how most serverless blogs work.</p>
        <p>In the meanwhile, here&#39;s a quick picture of something that happened to one of
        my characters when I failed to draw their hair well:</p>
