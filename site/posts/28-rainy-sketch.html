        <p>I referenced a lot of photos and other artists&#39; drawings to throw together this, but what turned out was rather different from the pictures I used. I like this, though!</p>
        <p>There wasn&#39;t really a &quot;hardest part&quot; to this; figuring out the leg shape took a while, but so did the head (front-facing beaks are hard to draw!), and I spent a fair amount of time just thinking about it, doodling the dress and body shape.</p>
        <p>The rain was added on after; I really like it - it makes the whole scene look more real. I&#39;ve also got a save of the rain-less version. If you&#39;re curious, you can see that <a href="static/media/28-sketchen-drier.png">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Also, yay, full body sketches??! I don&#39;t do these enough - they really give a lot of interesting practice!</p>
