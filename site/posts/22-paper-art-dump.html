        <p>Over the last month or so, I&#39;ve drawn.. a few things. Not enough! - But here&#39;s some of what I did.</p>
        <p><img src="static/media/22-sketch-of-ske-1.png" alt="Sketch of ske (1)">
        <img src="static/media/22-sketch-of-ske-2.png" alt="Sketch of ske (2)"></p>
        <p>These two are somewhat early sketches of <a href="posts/21-digital-art-again.html">the person I drew last time</a>. Originally I&#39;d actually been planning on a totally different style (and even a different character) for that picture; I like how it turned out, though!</p>
        <p>(Okay, now I <em>have</em> to explain - I had been thinking of a black-and-white (like, really 000000 and FFFFFF - no grayscale) digital drawing with [character name] sorta staring off like in those sketches. Who knows, maybe I&#39;ll try something like that some other time?)</p>
        <p><img src="static/media/22-beken-kleur.png" alt="Beken Kleur"></p>
        <p>My sister asked me to find a person on Google images and draw them. I did.</p>
        <p>This drawing is based off of <a href="http://www.hrc.ugent.be/staff/christophe-van-der-beken/">Dr. Christophe van der Beken</a>. I just realized my written credits on the drawing refers to a &quot;Christopher&quot;, but the guy here is named &quot;Cristophe&quot;, so.. oops! (Also &quot;Kleur&quot; - I have no idea what I was reading when I wrote it???)</p>
        <p><img src="static/media/22-nice-flower.png" alt="Flower bear thing?"></p>
        <p>This is a.. flower bear thing? In any case, it&#39;s a full character picture, which I haven&#39;t done many of.</p>
        <p><img src="static/media/22-sleep.png" alt="Sleeping has been proven to be necessary">
        <img src="static/media/22-sleep-please.png" alt="Not so good for comfort"></p>
        <p>Who needs sleep? This character, apparently, who is stuck in a house avoiding the 800-celsius, moonlit outside. Too bad their efforts don&#39;t help much.</p>
        <p>I drew this in the middle of the night. I actually wasn&#39;t having any trouble sleeping; I just wanted to draw something.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>I&#39;ve found drawing with a plain old pencil and paper easier than on a computer. I&#39;m scared to death of using color on a paper picture, though; probably actually trying it (and maybe using a non-erasable pen, rather than a pencil?) would help.</p>
