        <p>This last week or so was pretty productive! I think the world ended a few
        times, the general state of everything everywhere got worse, and several of
        the things you always thought was good has apparently been for evil and
        malevolent causes. Welcome to humanity. (Some exaggeration implied.)</p>
        <p><em>Locally,</em> I made a few things! Chronological order is the easiest way to
        write, so..</p>
        <p>I made a Dragon Quest IX alchemy thing. You give it the name of an alchemy
        recipe; it tells you all the ingredients that are needed, and all the
        ingredients required to make each of those ingredients, and so on (down to
        ingredients that can&#39;t be alchemized). That took a while to make - <em>mostly</em>
        because of the gigantic file storing all the recipes in the game (that I&#39;ve
        discovered) that I typed out by hand. It mostly looks like
        <a href="static/media/10-recipe-file-screenshot.png">this</a>.</p>
        <p>I worked on Ludum Depot 38 Cool Edition a bit. <a href="https://eevee.itch.io/lunar-depot-38">Ludum Depot 38</a> is a
        game <a href="https://twitter.com/eevee/">eevee</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/glitchedpuppet/">glitchedpuppet</a> made; Cool Edition is an
        endless (infinity waves) version of that game that I&#39;m working on. Basically
        I implemented a few suggestions that Opa-Opa gave;
        <a href="static/media/10-thanks.png">read them</a> if you&#39;re interested.</p>
        <p>I spent an hour or so making a thing to download all the K&#39;NEX manuals that
        are officially available online for the general public. Then I discovered that
        the directory containing all those PDFs is already <a href="http://media.knex.com/instructions/">easy to view</a>.
        That did give me a bit of a reason to write a generic Apache-folder downloader,
        though! The output folder is currently sitting on my desktop and weighs well
        over 13 gigabytes. Those files are kind of pointless and should probably be
        removed from my hard drive.</p>
        <p>I made a program that more or less imports images into [Sploder][sploder]
        games. (You can&#39;t import images in the custom graphics editor, and even if you
        could, they&#39;d only be 16x16 tiles; which wouldn&#39;t be manually feasible for
        large tiles!) That ended up looking something like this:</p>
