        <p>I haven&#39;t drawn anything digitally for a while! Making this was pretty fun (more fun than my last experience with trying to draw something digitally, for sure).</p>
        <p>I wasn&#39;t originally aiming to make something with this sort of sketch-like style, but I like how it turned out.</p>
        <p>Here&#39;s the MediBang Paint <a href="static/media/21-ske.mdp">source file</a>, if you&#39;re curious. I need to set up a proper license page - for now take the art I release as <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International</a>! (Basically, you&#39;re free to make a remix of my picture, or use it in your own project, as long as you give (visible) credits to me for making it, or the original version of it (ideally with a link back here). You must also share the work which remixed or used mine under this same license, so other people can freely build on your remix, as well.)</p>
