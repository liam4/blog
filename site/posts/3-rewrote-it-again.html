        <p>Tadaaa! It&#39;s now all-shiny and new.</p>
        <p>If I&#39;m lucky you won&#39;t notice much of a difference in the actual site. It&#39;s
        got the same stylesheet it used to have. All of the webpage rendering is done
        on my computer before the site is published to GitHub Pages - <em>not</em> by your
        web browser. That means the site should work on practically any device,
        regardless of JavaScript support (though, of course, Disqus still won&#39;t work
        on no-script browsers).</p>
        <p>There <em>is</em> a better archive section, though. It&#39;s now split into multiple
        categories, and those (probably) function fine, so that&#39;s user-visible
        progress!</p>
        <p>I&#39;d like to seriously post some new art here, but I haven&#39;t drawn much
        recently! ..haha, that&#39;s a fun excuse. I did work a bit on practicing some
        lighting techniques but it didn&#39;t turn out as well as I was hoping it to (duh).
        I guess it was still worth doing, though, since practice, and also because I
        figured out a better way of practicing.</p>
