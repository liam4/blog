# A snake, maybe?

![A snake-like thing](static/media/08-a-snake-maybe.png)

I drew a little thing. This spawned from me drawing random shapes on a canvas
while being uninterested in drawing anything late last night, then accidentally
painting [an idea-spawning shape](static/media/08-idea.png).

This is the first post I've published on an odd-numbered day! That's a little
bit frustrating, but I guess it isn't really worth stressing over, since I
don't even have a when-to-post schedule.
