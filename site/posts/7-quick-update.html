        <p>So I know it looks like I&#39;ve abandoned the blog. As it would turn out, I
        haven&#39;t! ––</p>
        <p><img src="static/media/07-abandon.png" alt="&quot;abandon&quot;: cease to support or look after (someone); desert."></p>
        <p>Okay, I <em>guess</em> I&#39;ve abandoned the blog a little. But the second definition
        there certainly hasn&#39;t happened:</p>
        <p><img src="static/media/07-abandon-2.png" alt="&quot;abandon&quot;: give up completely (a course of action, a practice, or a way of thinking)."></p>
        <p>I&#39;ve actually been looking for things to write about. I&#39;ve had a little bit of
        trouble since I mostly haven&#39;t made very many things in the last couple weeks
        (wait, <em>three</em> weeks..? Sorry - really.), but I&#39;ve made a few things now, so I
        can share those.</p>
        <h2 id="a-discord-game">A Discord game</h2>
        <p>I wrote a bit of code for a Discord multi-user-dungeon/domain/what<em>ever</em>. It&#39;s
        almost definitely not going to go anywhere, but it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve really
        written any code in the last week or so, and I&#39;d rathre not get rusty.</p>
        <p>The test server isn&#39;t public right now, since that&#39;s all it is - a bot testing
        server. It&#39;s also kind of a collaboration with a friend of mine[*]; we haven&#39;t
        really figured out any of the story. At all. At <em>all.</em> We also have basically
        no experience with games like this, either (or really any multiplayer games),
        so this is really just a programming project for me, haha.</p>
        <p>(* His online username changes every half-week or so, but right now it&#39;s
        <a href="https://github.com/lightblub">lightblub</a>. If you look for the user &quot;alex&quot; in
        <a href="https://github.com/orgs/coolandgood/people">this GitHub organization</a> that he and I are a part of, you can probably find him. Hey, I&#39;m not giving you instructions on how to stalk his
        every move, just a means of seeing all the cool projects he&#39;s worked on!
        <code>SMILEY_FACE.</code>)</p>
        <h2 id="some-art">Some art</h2>
        <p>I did a little bit of art? Not near as much as I wanted to, though. Here&#39;s what
        I drew in the time:</p>
        <p><img src="static/media/07-cayenne-colored.png" alt="Cayenne, except he is colorful"></p>
        <p>Here&#39;s a drawing of <a href="http://floraverse.com/comic/oneshots/96-character-profile-cayenne/">Cayenne</a>. His ears are pretty fun to draw
        (I&#39;ve got a scan of the uncolored version, too,
        <a href="static/media/07-cayenne-sketch.png">if you&#39;re curious</a>). I tried a kinda interesting
        lighting-border technique in this picture, which turned out to work pretty
        well, I guess. (I also have a scan of <a href="static/media/07-cayenne-page.png">the full page</a>. The color
        palette is made up of Crayola pencil names.)</p>
        <p>Coloring with coloring pencils is pretty fun. It&#39;s not really <em>easier</em> than
        using some digital art&#39;s brushes, but it definitely has a different feel. It
        feels better when I&#39;m shading with a pencil like these - you end up with a bit
        more of a natural shade color, I guess. Coloring highlights really is just the
        same as not shading as much wherever your highlight is. I guess there&#39;s
        specific brushes on digital art programs that work more like coloring
        pencils than, say, a wet brush? (I mean, of <em>course</em> a wet brush will be more
        like painting than coloring.. duh.)</p>
        <p><img src="static/media/07-my-art-is-deteriorating.png" alt="SPOILERS!!!! it&#39;s a bowl of vegetables and/or vegetables."></p>
        <p>This drawing&#39;s supposedly supposed to be a picture of a bowl of fruits and
        vegetables and whatnot. Everybody else was drawing things without using any
        line art at all, so, I guess I tried to do something, too? It&#39;s not
        particularly good though!</p>
        <h2 id="-the-story-posts-4-wrote-a-thing-html-"><a href="posts/4-wrote-a-thing.html">The story</a></h2>
        <p>I didn&#39;t work on the story.</p>
        <p>I know - disappointing. I still <em>like</em> the idea for the story, but I didn&#39;t go
        far with it. That&#39;s kind of been how most of my stories go - and many of my
        non-writing related projects too, I guess. Maybe I&#39;ll pick up with the idea
        again eventually, since writing stories still sounds like a really cool idea to
        me, but I haven&#39;t really felt like it lately. The trouble is that I haven&#39;t
        gotten any ideas, any spurts of, &quot;oh, <em>this</em> would work&quot; - but that kind of
        stems from the fact that I didn&#39;t really bother thinking about it much. So!
        Again, maybe I&#39;ll work on it again eventually. When I feel like writing, I&#39;ll
        have a (bare beginning of a) story to go to, so, who knows? I&#39;ll probably see
        more of it, eventually.</p>
        <h2 id="so-">So.</h2>
        <p>Such ends the Quick(tm) update.</p>
        <p>Since I know there&#39;s thousands of you readers dying to comment on my posts,
        it really doesn&#39;t take any effort - you can sign up for Disqus right through
        the commenting form at the bottom of all post pages, and that&#39;s not even
        <em>necessary</em>, since you can also use Google or Twitter just like that!
        (Or, ugh, Facebook.)</p>
        <p>(You lost the game. Okay, bye!)</p>
