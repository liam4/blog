        <p>Welcome to the site! I use this place to <a href="archive/text.html">ramble</a> and
        <a href="archive/art.html">share stuff I&#39;ve drawn</a>. Maybe some of it&#39;ll be interesting
        to someone.</p>
        <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
        <p><strong>towerofnix is really hard to pronounce and write and say. Any other names??</strong>
        You might want to stick to towerofnix if you&#39;re specifically talking about,
        e.g., my blog, my YouTube channel, or whatever. That&#39;s the username I&#39;ve taken
        for myself, and it&#39;s what people can search to find me. Typically Florrie is
        best, but if you know me (i.e. have talked to me multiple times before,
        especially in contexts where I do or did use the name) I won&#39;t yell at you for
        using Liam.</p>
        <p>I don&#39;t capitalize towerofnix, but you can and I won&#39;t yell at you for it.</p>
        <p><strong>How frequently asked are these questions?</strong> Never. Ask me some questions,
        please? Posting on <a href="index.html">my latest post</a> or emailing me (guess it; hint,
        gmail) both work.</p>
