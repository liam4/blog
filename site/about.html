        <p>Welcome to the site! I use this place to <a href="archive/text.html">ramble</a> and
        <a href="archive/art.html">share stuff I&#39;ve drawn</a>. Maybe some of it&#39;ll be interesting
        to someone.</p>
        <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
        <p><strong>I want to contact you or comment on one of your posts but have no idea how.</strong>
        Sending me a tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/towerofnix">@towerofnix</a>, a post on <a href="https://cybre.space/@florrie">mastodon</a>, or
        <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/guess#TRY-GMAIL">an email</a> is probably the best way right now.</p>
        <p><strong>towerofnix is really hard to pronounce and write and say. Any other names??</strong>
        You might want to stick to towerofnix if you&#39;re specifically talking about,
        e.g., my blog, my YouTube channel, or whatever. That&#39;s the username I&#39;ve taken
        for myself, and it&#39;s what people can search to find me. But if you&#39;re talking
        about me, as a person, please use Florrie. (If you&#39;re curious, there&#39;s a whole
        blog post on this topic <a href="posts/20-on-confusion-related-to-my-usernames.html">here</a>!)</p>
        <p><strong>What&#39;s this blog engine?</strong>
        It&#39;s a completely custom, hand-made one. <a href="https://github.com/towerofnix/blog">Here&#39;s the source code</a>
        if you want to use it or just play around with it.</p>
        <p><strong>What the eff is the standard text editor and why is it ed(1)?</strong>
        Apparently, ed is useful because you can use it on just about any Unix system.
        (I think that&#39;s why the call it &quot;standard&quot;.) So if you know how to use it,
        you&#39;ll never be without the ability to harness its amazing splendid powers.
        A little wikipediabird is telling me that ed was developed in 1969, which
        should be enough reason for <em>anybody</em> to learn it, but I&#39;ve never actually
        used it myself. Oops.</p>
        <p><strong>How frequently asked are these questions?</strong> Never. Ask me some questions,
        please? (Hint: see FAQ.)</p>
