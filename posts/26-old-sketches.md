I found these old sketches in a folder I hadn't touched for a year or so. I like them, so - here they are! I think I drew these at a friend's house in mid-late-ish 2016; I guess my sketch style hasn't changed all that much since then.

(One thing I noticed, looking at these pictures again, is that they're almost like pen sketches. I don't think I had an eraser on hand at the time. Maybe I should try more eraser-less sketches.. these have a nice style, but I think they also radiate a bit more emotion than most of my digital or with-eraser drawings!)
