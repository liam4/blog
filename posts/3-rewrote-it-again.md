# Rewrote it Again

Tadaaa! It's now all-shiny and new.

If I'm lucky you won't notice much of a difference in the actual site. It's
got the same stylesheet it used to have. All of the webpage rendering is done
on my computer before the site is published to GitHub Pages - *not* by your
web browser. That means the site should work on practically any device,
regardless of JavaScript support (though, of course, Discord still won't work
on no-script browsers).

There *is* a better archive section, though. It's now split into multiple
categories, and those (probably) function fine, so that's user-visible
progress!

I'd like to seriously post some new art here, but I haven't drawn much
recently! ..haha, that's a fun excuse. I did work a bit on practicing some
lighting techniques but it didn't turn out as well as I was hoping it to (duh).
I guess it was still worth doing, though, since practice, and also because I
figured out a better way of practicing.
