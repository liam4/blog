# I Wrote a Thing

I wrote a thing. Just kidding! I wrote an *idea* for a thing. Eventually it'll
hopefully turn into a real story, but I've got absolutely zero experience with
writing stories, and even less dedicating to relatively big projects.

I'd like to do some concept art for the project. In my head I imagined it as a
super fancy art project, but that's kind of a crazy idea, since the thing's so
(relatively) big. So I'll most likely write it as a proper story first. Maybe I
could try having pictures appear inside the page, so that there's still art to
look at (in a printed version of it, anyways[\*]), and I get to have somewhere
to present the art (other than here).

(\* I'm *not* making this a proper printed sold in stores thing, haha. It's
just a thing that's stemmed from a school assignment. I'll probably print it
for myself. That is, if I go anywhere with it.)
