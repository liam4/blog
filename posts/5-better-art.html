        <p><img src="static/media/05-character.png" alt="A new character"></p>
        <p>I drew this character earlier. They&#39;re not really of a specific species, nor do
        they have a story (or name..), but it&#39;s an interesting art piece (to me) for
        several reasons..</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>It&#39;s the first drawing I made using a sketch.</strong> That said, I&#39;m not entirely
        sure what counts as a sketch, but I <em>think</em> <a href="static/media/05-sketch.png">this</a> does? I drew the
        sketch using a single basic wet brush at a fixed size, then later (the next
        day) drew over (a transparent version of) it with more detail and such.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><strong>The body proportions make (more) sense.</strong> I&#39;ve drawn very few full-body
        humanoids, but the general body size seems to be a bit better on this. Maybe
        their head is a bit big..? But I think I found that making the head much
        smaller just didn&#39;t look as good.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><strong>It&#39;s a relatively detailed drawing.</strong> I tried a few things with this
        picture that mostly worked well, I think. Most obvious is the neck fur,
        which I definitely <em>didn&#39;t</em> steal from probably every drawing of this type
        of creature, ever. Their head also looks pretty fluffy, which is definitely
        what I was going for. There&#39;s also some subtle details I probably could have
        made a bit more visible - some lighting experimentation, inner-ear coloring,
        and the whole shadow-above-nose effect.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>So it&#39;s a better piece than most of my previous stuff. Progress feels good?
        (Then again, I still don&#39;t really do <em>enough</em> practice! This was the first
        picture I&#39;d drawn in just over a week.)</p>
        <p>I also worked a little bit on the story idea I <a href="posts/4-wrote-a-thing.html">had</a>. I wrote out a bit
        of plot for a new character (no, this isn&#39;t a picture of her). I&#39;m kind of
        wondering how many tropes or clich√©s it&#39;s fitting in to, though? That&#39;s
        probably something every writer gets at some point, but I&#39;m going to try not to
        let it get too much in the way of me writing. Practice makes perfect, so I
        can&#39;t really let myself get discouraged by focusing too much on all the common
        story issues I&#39;m falling into!</p>
