# Quick update

So I know it looks like I've abandoned the blog. As it would turn out, I
haven't! ––

!["abandon": cease to support or look after (someone); desert.](static/media/07-abandon.png)

Okay, I *guess* I've abandoned the blog a little. But the second definition
there certainly hasn't happened:

!["abandon": give up completely (a course of action, a practice, or a way of thinking).](static/media/07-abandon-2.png)

I've actually been looking for things to write about. I've had a little bit of
trouble since I mostly haven't made very many things in the last couple weeks
(wait, *three* weeks..? Sorry - really.), but I've made a few things now, so I
can share those.

## A Discord game

I wrote a bit of code for a Discord multi-user-dungeon/domain/what*ever*. It's
almost definitely not going to go anywhere, but it's the first time I've really
written any code in the last week or so, and I'd rathre not get rusty.

The test server isn't public right now, since that's all it is - a bot testing
server. It's also kind of a collaboration with a friend of mine[\*]; we haven't
really figured out any of the story. At all. At *all.* We also have basically
no experience with games like this, either (or really any multiplayer games),
so this is really just a programming project for me, haha.

(\* His online username changes every half-week or so, but right now it's
[lightblub][lightblub]. If you look for the user "alex" in
[this GitHub organization][coolandgood] that he and I are a part of, you can probably find him. Hey, I'm not giving you instructions on how to stalk his
every move, just a means of seeing all the cool projects he's worked on!

## Some art

I did a little bit of art? Not near as much as I wanted to, though. Here's what
I drew in the time:

![Cayenne, except he is colorful](static/media/07-cayenne-colored.png)

Here's a drawing of [Cayenne][cayenne-profile]. His ears are pretty fun to draw
(I've got a scan of the uncolored version, too,
[if you're curious][cayenne-sketch]). I tried a kinda interesting
lighting-border technique in this picture, which turned out to work pretty
well, I guess. (I also have a scan of [the full page][cayenne-page]. The color
palette is made up of Crayola pencil names.)

Coloring with coloring pencils is pretty fun. It's not really *easier* than
using some digital art's brushes, but it definitely has a different feel. It
feels better when I'm shading with a pencil like these - you end up with a bit
more of a natural shade color, I guess. Coloring highlights really is just the
same as not shading as much wherever your highlight is. I guess there's
specific brushes on digital art programs that work more like coloring
pencils than, say, a wet brush? (I mean, of *course* a wet brush will be more
like painting than coloring.. duh.)

![SPOILERS!!!! it's a bowl of vegetables and/or vegetables.](static/media/07-my-art-is-deteriorating.png)

This drawing's supposedly supposed to be a picture of a bowl of fruits and
vegetables and whatnot. Everybody else was drawing things without using any
line art at all, so, I guess I tried to do something, too? It's not
particularly good though!

## [The story](posts/4-wrote-a-thing.html)

I didn't work on the story.

I know - disappointing. I still *like* the idea for the story, but I didn't go
far with it. That's kind of been how most of my stories go - and many of my
non-writing related projects too, I guess. Maybe I'll pick up with the idea
again eventually, since writing stories still sounds like a really cool idea to
me, but I haven't really felt like it lately. The trouble is that I haven't
gotten any ideas, any spurts of, "oh, *this* would work" - but that kind of
stems from the fact that I didn't really bother thinking about it much. So!
Again, maybe I'll work on it again eventually. When I feel like writing, I'll
have a (bare beginning of a) story to go to, so, who knows? I'll probably see
more of it, eventually.

## So.

Such ends the Quick(tm) update.

Since I know there's thousands of you readers dying to comment on my posts,
it really doesn't take any effort - you can sign up for Disqus right through
the commenting form at the bottom of all post pages, and that's not even
*necessary*, since you can also use Google or Twitter just like that!
(Or, ugh, Facebook.)

(You lost the game. Okay, bye!)
