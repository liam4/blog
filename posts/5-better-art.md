# Better Art

![A new character](static/media/05-character.png)

I drew this character earlier. They're not really of a specific species, nor do
they have a story (or name..), but it's an interesting art piece (to me) for
several reasons..

* **It's the first drawing I made using a sketch.** That said, I'm not entirely
  sure what counts as a sketch, but I *think* [this][sketch] does? I drew the
  sketch using a single basic wet brush at a fixed size, then later (the next
  day) drew over (a transparent version of) it with more detail and such.

* **The body proportions make (more) sense.** I've drawn very few full-body
  humanoids, but the general body size seems to be a bit better on this. Maybe
  their head is a bit big..? But I think I found that making the head much
  smaller just didn't look as good.

* **It's a relatively detailed drawing.** I tried a few things with this
  picture that mostly worked well, I think. Most obvious is the neck fur,
  which I definitely *didn't* steal from probably every drawing of this type
  of creature, ever. Their head also looks pretty fluffy, which is definitely
  what I was going for. There's also some subtle details I probably could have
  made a bit more visible - some lighting experimentation, inner-ear coloring,
  and the whole shadow-above-nose effect.

So it's a better piece than most of my previous stuff. Progress feels good?
(Then again, I still don't really do *enough* practice! This was the first
picture I'd drawn in just over a week.)

I also worked a little bit on the story idea I [had][story]. I wrote out a bit
of plot for a new character (no, this isn't a picture of her). I'm kind of
wondering how many tropes or clich√©s it's fitting in to, though? That's
probably something every writer gets at some point, but I'm going to try not to
let it get too much in the way of me writing. Practice makes perfect, so I
can't really let myself get discouraged by focusing too much on all the common
story issues I'm falling into!
