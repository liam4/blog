Welcome to the site! I use this place to [ramble](archive/text.html) and
[share stuff I've drawn](archive/art.html). Maybe some of it'll be interesting
to someone.

## FAQ

**towerofnix is really hard to pronounce and write and say. Any other names??**
You might want to stick to towerofnix if you're specifically talking about,
e.g., my blog, my YouTube channel, or whatever. That's the name I've taken
for myself, and it's what people can search to find me. Typically Florrie is
best, but if you know me (i.e. have talked to me multiple times before,
especially in contexts where I do or did use the name) I won't yell at you for
using Liam.

I don't capitalize towerofnix, but you can and I won't yell at you for it.

**How frequently asked are these questions?** Never. Ask me some questions,
please? Posting on [my latest post](index.html) or emailing me (guess it; hint,
gmail) both work.
