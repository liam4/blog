# towerofnix's Blog Site

Welcome to the site! I use this place to [ramble](archive/text.html) and
[share stuff I've drawn](archive/art.html). Maybe some of it'll be interesting
to someone.

## FAQ

**I want to contact you or comment on one of your posts but have no idea how.**
Sending me a tweet [@towerofnix][twitter] or [an email][guess] is probably the
best way right now.

**towerofnix is really hard to pronounce and write and say. Any other names??**
You might want to stick to towerofnix if you're specifically talking about,
e.g., my blog, my YouTube channel, or whatever. That's the username I've taken
for myself, and it's what people can search to find me. But if you're talking
about me, as a person, please use Florrie. (If you're curious, there's a whole
blog post on this topic [here][usernames-post]!)

**How frequently asked are these questions?** Never. Ask me some questions,
please? (Hint: see FAQ.)
