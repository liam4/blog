# I accidentally drew some things

I found myself in a place where my only items on hand were a note-pad and a
pencil. As it would turn out, "the amount of in-this-situation I am" and "the
amount of art I make" is directly proportionate; so I ended up drawing a few
sketches:

I guess I also painted something a little while earlier; I only used a single
color because I have *no* idea how color blending works.
