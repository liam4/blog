# Domain transfer?!?! + Mastodon

Courtesy of super-awesome [eq][eq], my site is now hosted on florrie.[ed1.club][ed1club] instead of towerofnix.github.io! Yay!!! <code>SPARKLES EMOJI</code> <code>SPARKLES EMOJI</code> <code>SPARKLES EMOJI</code>!

I'll eventually get around to updating all the links to towerofnix.github.io/blog, but I already have a redirection system in place to make the transition a lot smoother.

I've somehow managed to not get around to mentioning it on my blog, but.....

I've got a Mastodon account! It's [florrie@cybre.space][flcybre]. Cybre.space is supre cool. (I did *not* make that typo on purpose.) I post my art there before I put it up here on my blog, for a few reasons:

* Putting together and publishing a blog post is kind of difficult. I've written my blog system to be as pain-free as possible, but it's just not as easy as typing a toot and hitting send. Keeping it simple to share my art means I get to focus on what I'm drawing instead of the process of sticking it online, since...

* I still put my art on this blog, but only once every month or so. (You've noticed my art dumps, right?) Posting it in batches does keep my archive a bit cleaner, which is nice.

* Posting art in batches lets me refine art when I want to. I made a doodle earlier this month and changed some things about it since; if I'd already posted the art on my blog, I would have had to update the krita and PNG files, and then go through the entire process of pushing my site again.

* My Mastodon account's toots are set to private by default: only my followers can see them (and I have to manually approve follow requests). This makes it a lot easier to share things online - when I draw my art, I don't have to worry about what the entire world is going to think of it. It's easy for me to just decide to keep the piece exclusive to my hand-selected followers on Mastodon.

The tl;dr is: **If you follow [me on Mastodon][flcybre] (and I accept your follow request), you will get access to my art earlier than when I post it on my blog.**

Also, eq helped me get some directory listings set up here. If you go to [florrie.ed1.club/stuff][stuff], you may or may not find random junk I throw there; I usually just use cubeupload, so it probably won't be populated all that quickly. I've also got a /private folder for the Krita files of things I share on Mastodon but don't plan on posting to my blog. (Obviously, that directory is password-protected. If you want access, and I've accepted your follow request on Mastodon, I can probably add an entry for you in my htpasswd file. Or something. I don't 100% know how I'm going to use the folder yet!)
