# Productivity idea

Maybe it'd be easier to accomplish things if the objectives were less general.
"Draw a picture" is obviously less specific than "draw a picture to work on
figuring out how character lighting works". Importantly, looking at a goal kind
of makes you think about how you haven't gotten the goal already. I think that
"draw a picture, because you haven't drawn one in ages" is less, well, harsh,
than "work on character lighting, because it'd be nice to be better at that".
(Sure, you *could* instead say "work on character lighting, because you're
terrible at it" or you *could* say "draw a picture, because it'd be nice to
draw things more frequently"; but those are the thoughts that come to *my*
mind.)
