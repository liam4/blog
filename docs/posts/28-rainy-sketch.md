# Rainy sketch

![Rainy sketch](static/media/28-sketchen.png)

I referenced a lot of photos and other artists' drawings to throw together this, but what turned out was rather different from the pictures I used. I like this, though!

There wasn't really a "hardest part" to this; figuring out the leg shape took a while, but so did the head (front-facing beaks are hard to draw!), and I spent a fair amount of time just thinking about it, doodling the dress and body shape.

The rain was added on after; I really like it - it makes the whole scene look more real. I've also got a save of the rain-less version. If you're curious, you can see that [here](static/media/28-sketchen-drier.png).

Also, yay, full body sketches??! I don't do these enough - they really give a lot of interesting practice!
