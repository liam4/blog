        <p>Say I&#39;ve got a friend online who sent a message to me. It&#39;d be something
        simple, just like, &quot;Hi!&quot;</p>
        <p>Okay, this message was sent.. half an hour ago. I missed it, because I wasn&#39;t
        on Discord or Twitter or email or whatever their client of choice was. Oops.
        Now I&#39;ve got two options:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Respond!</strong> Duh, one of my friends said hi, so I&#39;ll say hi back.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><strong>Procrastinate.</strong> Wait, what? Well, they sent the message half an hour ago..
        so it&#39;s not <em>that</em> bad if I don&#39;t get back to them right now.. hold on, why
        am I even thinking about this? But still..</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Alright, so, I imagine most people would go with the first option. Right?
        Because it makes <em>sense</em> to go and respond when someone says hi, plus typically
        conversations are good, anyways. They&#39;re enjoyable!</p>
        <p>..But I procrastinate. I know it&#39;s true that having a casual discussion with
        someone is basically always good, but I choose to wait, anyways?</p>
        <p>And I&#39;m not even <em>doing</em> anything! At that point in time I&#39;m probably just
        sitting around, doing nothing of particular interest. I <em>know</em> it&#39;d be more fun
        (and productive) to have a chat. But I delay it, for some reason?</p>
        <p>And this is consistently something true of me.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>I got an idea to work on a project with somebody the previous day.. and now,
        even though I know I&#39;d still like to work on that project with them, I delay.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>One of my friends said hello a while earlier. I choose to ignore them.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>One of my friends said hello <em>now</em>, while I&#39;m online. It&#39;s a lot less easy
        to ignore someone when they&#39;re talking to you while you&#39;re basically present,
        so, you know, I go and respond (&quot;Hi!&quot;), but there&#39;s still a bit of a feeling
        of &quot;no, no, hold on, ugh.&quot;</p>
        <p>(This is true for whenever I&#39;m talking to someone in a direct/private
        message online, mind you. It&#39;s not just some one person in particular!)</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>We&#39;ve got visitors; they only visit once or twice a year, so it&#39;s pretty
        special for both us and them. But before they arrive, there&#39;s a little
        feeling of dread.. even though I know their visits are always completely
        enjoyable! Once they get here, though, that feeling disappears.</p>
        <p>(Again, this is true for <em>any</em> visitors. Some people had come from quite
        far away - across an ocean, in fact! - to visit us, and, you know, that
        feeling of uncertainty (I guess?), before they arrived was still there.)</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It doesn&#39;t even have to be related to socializing, actually. Drawing art is
        another example of when this is an issue for me. I <em>know</em> I enjoy drawing!
        And yet I procrastinate. It doesn&#39;t seem to me like there&#39;s any <em>reason</em> to
        delay the inevitable <em>enjoyment</em> I&#39;ll get out of making a piece of art,
        especially when I tend to delay many other unrelated things I also enjoy.</p>
        <p>I know this is also a problem for others. It certainly doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s
        an issue for <em>most</em> others, though!</p>
        <p>I&#39;m not entirely sure how to deal with it. It&#39;s frustrating, because it <em>is</em> a
        bit of a real problem for me. It seriously does get in the way of my drawing -
        it&#39;s definitely the reason I haven&#39;t made much of any art in the last few
        weeks. It&#39;s gotten in the way of lots of projects I want to work on, with
        myself, or with others.</p>
        <h2 id="internet-ritual">Internet ritual</h2>
        <p>Open your browser. Check what&#39;s new on Twitter. Check if anybody&#39;s uploaded an
        interesting video to YouTube. Catch up with Facebook. Check the notifications
        you&#39;ve got on any forum you browse. See what people are up to on that one
        subreddit. (Maybe even check the /new section.)</p>
        <p>Doing what you want to, doing what you need to, socializing - it&#39;s all hard.
        Procrastination is easy. Why would you bother doing something that takes any
        effort or willpower when you could do something that <em>doesn&#39;t?</em></p>
        <p>And it&#39;s <em>so</em> easy. One option is tough; one isn&#39;t. <em>You</em> don&#39;t even need to
        make the choice consciously; chances are your brain will for you. And then go
        with that, right?</p>
        <p>Chances are you don&#39;t even <em>want</em> to do that one thing you claim you do. Oh,
        yeah! You know how there&#39;s that one person that just messaged you? And how
        you&#39;ve meant to talk to them? ..But you don&#39;t. Responding is hard. You tell
        yourself you enjoy discussing things with people.. but that&#39;s not a simple
        task; do you <em>really</em> enjoy it?</p>
        <p>Procrastinate, instead.</p>
        <p>Maybe don&#39;t even respond at all.</p>
        <h2 id="or-not-">Or not?</h2>
        <p>It&#39;s not easy to get out of those thoughts. You&#39;ve literally already convinced
        yourself that it&#39;d just be easier to stick to procrastinating, to stick to that
        consistently easy, simple, internet ritual. They aren&#39;t even always conscious
        thoughts; it&#39;s just, &quot;oh, hmm, may as well check what&#39;s new!&quot;</p>
        <p>But they&#39;re <em>intrusive.</em> Obviously they do get in the way of your life, and the
        things you <em>do</em> enjoy. Before talking to someone, it&#39;s easy to convince
        yourself that you don&#39;t really enjoy it. But you clearly <em>do</em> like talking to
        people; it&#39;s quite possible that you&#39;ve talked to this very person before, and
        enjoyed it!</p>
        <p>They get in the way of doing other things, too, of course - why create
        something when it&#39;s so much easier to just.. not? And yet I <em>do</em> love drawing
        things! It&#39;s the best feeling I get!</p>
        <p>It&#39;s now been a week since I wrote the first section of this post. The other
        day I was talking to a friend of mine about all this; that lead to me making
        the decision to kill the so-called internet ritual as best I could. So I&#39;ve
        been working on that, myself.</p>
        <p>Will that magically solve all my problems? Will it make talking to people much
        easier, suddenly? Probably not! But maybe it&#39;ll help. I <em>think</em> it will; it&#39;s
        been somewhat helpful so far. I&#39;ve gotten a bit better at following my basic
        goals since I did, and I think I&#39;ve also felt a little better about myself i
        general.</p>
        <p>Call it all a placebo effect if it is, but I guess it&#39;s enough, anyways. If I&#39;m
        feeling better about myself and finding it easier to do what I want and need
        to, it&#39;s working. Who knows how it&#39;ll go from here?</p>
        <p>(PS, while writing the later parts of this, I&#39;ve been listening to
        <a href="https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/dief">Dief</a>, which I&#39;ve found to be shockingly
        appropriate background music for this post!)</p>
