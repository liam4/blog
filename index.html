        <p>There&#39;s been an awful lot of confusion as to which of my Scratch accounts are which, and what the purpose of each one is, so I&#39;m feeling obliged to make a hopefully-helpful guide to it all. I probably should have sooner!</p>
        <p>Since my names and handles are rather more complicated than being limited to Scratch alone, I&#39;m including some needed info on my names on other sites as well.</p>
        <p>Disclaimer: I spent two hours around midnight writing this; I haven&#39;t significantly re-read it. Also, you might be more confused <em>after</em> you read, since I probably didn&#39;t do a great job at explaining all this; feel free to ask about anything if you want (info on how to do that&#39;s at the bottom of this post, but too-long-didn&#39;t-scroll just comment on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/fIorrie/">fIorrie</a> or email me).</p>

        <h2 id="early-accounts">Early accounts</h2>
        <p>Let&#39;s start at the beginning. In 2007, I created an account for the Poptropica site. I gave it the username <code>liam4</code>, since my name was Liam and I was four years old.</p>
        <p>In February 2013, a bit more than four and a half years ago, I created my first Scratch account, ginving it the username <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/liam48D/"><code>liam48D</code></a>. (This was, for all practical purposes, my first real existence on the internet, besides a few comments on some KhanAcademy videos.) I figured I&#39;d take my Poptropica username and add a smiley face to the end; and such, <code>liam48D</code> became.</p>
        <p>In late 2014, I was getting more into text-based programming, so I created the GitHub account <code>liam4</code>. (The username was, obviously, the same as I&#39;d taken everywhere else; I guess I didn&#39;t feel that the smiley was necessary.)</p>
        <h2 id="towerofnix">towerofnix</h2>
        <p>Some time in 2015, I decided I wanted to make a separate user account on my laptop for myself to go through the activities and demos in <a href="http://unixmages.com/"><em>Unix for the Beginning Mage</em></a>, which I was reading, at the time, to learn basic shell usage. Having a separate account would keep the whole computer cleaner, and give me a fresh start. I gave the account the username <code>towerofnix</code>, which (of course) was based on the first paragraph of the book:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Hello, Young Mage! Welcome to the Tower of Nix! Here you&#39;ll begin your training in the skills of Unix. I&#39;ll be your Instructor and Narrator.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The username towerofnix stuck, and I began using it just about everywhere.</p>
        <p>In February 2016, I found myself in need of another Scratch account, so that I could practice playing with <a href="https://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Cloud_Data">cloud data</a> more; so, I created the account <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/_nix/"><code>_nix</code></a>. (Using <code>_nix</code> instead of <code>nix</code> was because the name actually came from &quot;*nix&quot;, in the sense of &quot;any Unix-like&quot; (obviously derived from towerofnix). Though I suppose it helped that <code>nix</code> was already taken.)</p>
        <p>A few months later (July of 2016), I created the Scratch user <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/towerofnix/"><code>towerofnix</code></a>. I created this account to make tutorials about programming with Scratch; I didn&#39;t go too far with it, though (only to <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/116852216/">one project</a>). I also made this account to post projects I put more effort into on, but by the time I completed any large projects I&#39;d mostly abandoned the towerofnix account...</p>
        <p>...Because, around the time I made the towerofnix account, I&#39;d been transitioning from using liam48D to _nix. As I moved towards _nix, I practically forgot about towerofnix; and I didn&#39;t really feel like separating my amazing projects from my simple test ones (in part because I wasn&#39;t actually completing any large oens!).</p>
        <p>Later I also made an email account, towerofnix-at-gmail, and a Twitter account, <a href="https://twitter.com/towerofnix/">@towerofnix</a>. Most accounts I have in other places (e.g. Stack Exchange) are also called towerofnix. I eventually renamed my GitHub account, liam4, to <a href="https://github.com/towerofnix/">towerofnix</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/liam4/">liam4</a> is now just a notice that I changed my username.)</p>
        <h2 id="florrie">Florrie</h2>
        <p>Okay, so, all of the above <em>probably</em> makes sense. (Hopefully?) But here&#39;s the topic of confusion and interest that&#39;s always brought up - what on <em>earth</em> is Florrie?</p>
        <p>The simple answer is the objective one; &quot;Florrie&quot; is a name. It&#39;s the <em>name</em> I go by online; the idea is that, when you&#39;re thinking of me, you don&#39;t think &quot;Nix&quot; or &quot;Tower of Nix&quot;, you think &quot;Florrie&quot;.</p>
        <p>The name &quot;Florrie&quot;&#39;s origin is.. sort of complicated.</p>
        <p>In online groups and such, I&#39;d been going by a few names. For a while, I was using &quot;Tonix&quot;. Tonix was made because I wanted (and needed) a name that was less of a mouthful than &quot;towerofnix&quot;, and a name that people could actually think of when they think of me.</p>
        <p>But Tonix just wasn&#39;t <em>good</em>. Tonix is pronounced like &quot;tonics&quot;, plural of tonic, and.. handy medicinal potions wasn&#39;t what I meant by the name. It also reminded me of the word &quot;toxic&quot;, which has <em>definitely</em> never been the connotation I&#39;ve wanted.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, my other ideas weren&#39;t that much better. I noticed some people called me &quot;Tower&quot; when speaking, and another called me Nix, but both of those were hardly <em>names</em>.</p>
        <p>&quot;Florrie&quot; happened on accident. A friend of mine called me Florrie one day (online), and, as soon as I read it, the name resonated with me.</p>
        <p>Okay, so, hold on, now everyone&#39;s confused - why not just use <em>Liam</em> as a name for people to know me by online? I could make a claim that I don&#39;t want people to know that people call me Liam in real life; but that&#39;s not really true, because my early accounts were all named &quot;liam&quot;-something, and I haven&#39;t tried to hide them at all. But, online (and to people I&#39;ve met online), I&#39;d rather not be called Liam - either Florrie or towerofnix is fine.</p>
        <h2 id="fiorrie">fIorrie</h2>
        <p>Another thing people are confused on - what&#39;s this <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/fIorrie/">fIorrie</a> account?</p>
        <p>The reasoning behind the name is simple; it&#39;s just &quot;florrie&quot;, but with the L replaced with an I, because florrie was already taken <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/florrie/">over nine years ago</a>. (It&#39;s still pronounced &quot;Florrie&quot;!)</p>
        <p>The Florrie user was created as an experiment to see how people would react to it. In the end, it ended up as a separate space for slightly more personal discussion that I didn&#39;t want immediately on my _nix page. <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/fIorrie/#comments">Have a look at its (earlier) comments!</a> (The comments are still public <em>so that</em> they can be read; I just didn&#39;t want them <em>immediately</em> on /users/_nix.)</p>
        <hr>
        <p>So, ah, that&#39;s my long-overdue formal/informal answer to some of the confusion people have had. If you have any questions or confusions at all, <em>please</em> feel free to ask; I probably did a terrible job at explaining most of this, and directly answering questions is a bit easier (and maybe more helpful) than making something like this.</p>
        <p>There&#39;s no comment system on my blog, but you can email me (you did catch my email, right?) or comment on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/fIorrie/">the fIorrie Scratch profile</a>. (The Scratch page is better; I prefer public conversations! But I&#39;m totally fine with email as well, if you&#39;d prefer.)</p>
